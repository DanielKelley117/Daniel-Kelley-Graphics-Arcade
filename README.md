# Daniel-Kelley-Graphics-Arcade
This is an arcade that I developed for my Advanced Programming Class. There are are 9 games, and 6 of them use graphics. The 3 games that do not use graphics were entirely written by me. The 6 games that do use graphics feature some code that was originally written by my instructor, Lisa Dion, but I have expanded on it greatly. Instructions for each of the games are below. Note that this program is run through the Arcade executable in CMakeLists.txt. All of the graphics games are accessed by selecting graphics, and the program will run the graphics executable. You can exit any of the graphics windows at any time by pressing the escape key. I hope you enjoy the Arcade!

# Finite Automaton
In for this game the computer generates a DFA that has an alphabet of 1s and 0s. You begin at the start state of the DFA, and need to type in the correct number of 1s and 0s to get to the accept state as fast as you can. The number of points you earn is based off of how many steps it takes you to get to the accept state.

# Programming Rumble
This is a turn based fighting game where the characters are programming languages. Select a character to play as, and a character to fight. For each turn, you can attack your opponent, use your special ability (which can only be used once), or feed (which takes some of your health away to increase your attack.) 

# Four Corners
This game uses text to speech, and is best played in a group of 3 or more. Use 4 corners in the room that you're in, and the computer will tell you when each round begins and ends. At the end of each round the computer will randomly select a corner, and all players in that corner will be eliminated. Remaining players can move to a new corner, or stay at the corner they're currently at.

# Cloud Dodger
Begin with your mouse at the top of the graphics window, and move the white box with your mouse up and down the screen. Dodge the clouds and hit the orange box as many times as you can. The number of points you earn is determined by how many times you're able to hit the orange box.

# Chaser
Begin with your mouse inside the big blue box. Use the arrow keys to move the blue box, and the mouse to move the white box. Touch the orange box as many times as you can without separating the white and blue boxes, or touching the white box to any of the moving boxes.

# Super Architect
Begin with your mouse at the top of the screen, and a white box will appear that follows your mouse throughout the game. Touch each of the buildings with the mouse as much as you want, and then touch the grass. The screen will generate 8 bit art based on what buildings you touched.

# Magic Key
Spawn 1000 bubbles on the screen with by pressing a letter key that changes every time it is pressed and more bubbles are spawned. Note that some of the bubbles may disappear due to a bug, but the game still remembers them, and they still count towards the number of bubbles currently generated.

# Cube Exercise
Move a rectanle around the screen with the arrow keys, and rotate it with the x and y keys. When you've exercised the cube enough, it will become 3 dimensional. Afterwards you can also move it with the . and , keys and rotate it with the z key.
